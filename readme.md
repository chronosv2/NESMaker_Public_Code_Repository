# NESMaker Public Code Repository
## Code by Chronosv2
## Repository uses NESMaker v4.0.11

This repository contains all the code I've written for use with the NESMaker game making platform.

Included Code Snippets:
### LongVarHUD:
Ever wanted a bar on screen longer than 8 tiles? This script allows you to combine two HUD Elements to make one longer element 9-16 tiles long. **Note:** If you wnt to update a bar and a number in NESMaker's HUD in one pass that's supported already and you __do not need my code__ to do so!
### CountDownTimer:
Used as the "Water" Gauge in my Desolate Desert Showcase ROM, this set of functions implements a counting down timer that, as of this code, hurts the player if the timer is at 000.
### NumberSplitting:
Used as the "Foe" Gauge in my Desolate Desert Showcase ROM, this set of functions implements splitting a byte of numbers (Monster HP) into individual numbers for use in the HUD.
### MoveAfterMelee:
Currently only contains a script that prevents animations from resetting if you set ChangeToWalkAnimation to HOLD direction.

# Use of the above code is free for any use, either commercial or otherwise, so long as you are not infringing upon the IP of others.
## Credit (to "chronosv2" or "Kevin S.") would be nice but is NOT REQUIRED.
